# Malware-Detection-Classifier--MidTerm-Project
Malware Classification using AWS SageMaker
Overview
This repository hosts an implementation for deploying a malware classification model using AWS SageMaker. The model is trained on the EMBER 2018 dataset and deployed as an API endpoint on SageMaker. It also includes a Python client for feature extraction from executable files and retrieving classification results from the deployed endpoint.

Introduction
Malware detection is an essential aspect of computer security. This project aims to provide a solution by deploying a machine learning model trained on the EMBER 2018 dataset to classify executable files as benign or malicious. Leveraging AWS SageMaker ensures scalability and reliability in the classification process.

Setup
To replicate the deployment and usage of the model, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone 
Install Dependencies:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Once the model is deployed, utilize the provided Python client to extract features from executable files and retrieve classification results from the SageMaker endpoint.

Performance Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the deployed model, a test set comprising 100 malware and 100 benign samples randomly selected from the EMBER 2018 dataset was used. Here are the classification results:

Malware Samples:

True Positives: 85
False Negatives: 15
Precision: 0.85
Recall: 0.85
Benign Samples:

True Negatives: 90
False Positives: 10
Precision: 0.9
Recall: 0.9

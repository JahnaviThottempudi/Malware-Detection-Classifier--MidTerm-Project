## MALWARE CLASSIFICATION USING AWS SAGEMAKER

## OVERVIEW

This repository hosts an implementation for deploying a malware classification model using AWS SageMaker. The model is trained and deployed as an API endpoint on SageMaker. It also includes a Python client for feature extraction from executable files and retrieving classification results from the deployed endpoint.

## DESCRIPTION
## TASK 1
  **Deploying the model as an API endpoint on AWS SageMaker.Â 
  
In this task, you will be creating and training a model to classify PE files as malware or benign.Once your model is trained, save and store the model. Then, create a function (or method) that takes a PE file as its argument, runs it through the trained model, and returns the output (i.e., Malware or Benign). And then you will be using Amazon Sagemaker to deploy your model on the cloud, and create an endpoint (~ API) so that other applications can make use of the model.

## TASK 2
   Developing a Python client which takes in an executable file, extracts relevant features, and retrieves classification results from the SageMaker endpoint.
   
## TASK 3
Randomly select 100 malware and 100 benign samples from EMBER 2018, and benchmark the performance of your deployed model on those samples.

## SETUP

To replicate the deployment and usage of the model, follow these steps:
1.	Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/JahnaviThottempudi/Malware-Detection-Classifier--MidTerm-Project.git
2. Presentation: https://youtu.be/pm4fWIxtees?si=_fDj2WNZuoXP_Z2E
3.	Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## USAGE

Once the model is deployed, utilize the provided Python client to extract features from executable files and retrieve classification results from the Sage Maker endpoint.

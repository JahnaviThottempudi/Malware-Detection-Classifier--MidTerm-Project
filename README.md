## MALWARE CLASSIFICATION USING AWS SAGEMAKER

## OVERVIEW

This repository hosts an implementation for deploying a malware classification model using AWS SageMaker. The model is trained on the EMBER 2018 dataset and deployed as an API endpoint on SageMaker. It also includes a Python client for feature extraction from executable files and retrieving classification results from the deployed endpoint.

## INTRODUCTION

Malware detection is an essential aspect of computer security. This project aims to provide a solution by deploying a machine learning model trained on the EMBER 2018 dataset to classify executable files as benign or malicious. Leveraging AWS Sage Maker ensures scalability and reliability in the classification process.

## SETUP

To replicate the deployment and usage of the model, follow these steps:
1.	Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/JahnaviThottempudi/Malware-Detection-Classifier--MidTerm-Project.git

3.	Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## USAGE

Once the model is deployed, utilize the provided Python client to extract features from executable files and retrieve classification results from the Sage Maker endpoint.

## PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

To evaluate the performance of the deployed model, a test set comprising 100 malware and 100 benign samples randomly selected from the EMBER 2018 dataset was used. Here are the classification results:

## MALWARE ANALYSIS

•	True Positives: 85 

•	False Negatives: 15 

•	Precision: 0.85 

•	Recall: 0.85

## BENIGN SAMPLES

•	True Negatives: 90 

•	False Positives: 10 

•	Precision: 0.9 

•	Recall: 0.9
